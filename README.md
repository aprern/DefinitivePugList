-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  A method for importing JSON feeds into the "Definitive Pug List" Google spreadsheet
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How it works:
Google sheets periodically runs an apps script  that checks this web-hosted CSV file and syncs the sheet to the csv file. In order to change the CSV file, you have to make a pull request on this project. The CSV file is in plaintext so things like font or color aren't carried over. 

How to edit the sheet:
Download the CSV file, and edit it in a CSV editor (google sheets/libreoffice/excel/apple numbers/etc.) After you have finished with your changes to the PugList, submit your new file as a pull request.The project maintainers will review your new file and edit it into the project CSV file if there aren't any errors.
